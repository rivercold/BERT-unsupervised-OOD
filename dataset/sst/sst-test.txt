302	The unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right .

324	I do n't know precisely what to make of Steven Soderbergh 's Full Frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .
325	The tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern China in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .

327	I enjoyed the ride -LRB- bumps and all -RRB- , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .
328	You could say that it 's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people would n't , but one thing you could n't say is that Alias Betty is predictable .

332	An amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail .
333	High on melodrama .
334	But it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .
335	Finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
336	It 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
337	Spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects .

361	A whole lot foul , freaky and funny .
362	Attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .
363	The diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time .

370	Bennett 's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that 's tough to shake .
371	An intriguing and entertaining introduction to Johnson .
372	As expected , Sayles ' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances .
373	A model of what films like this should be like .
374	As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the Cockettes were n't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create .
375	Yeah , these flicks are just that damn good .
376	Is n't it great ?
377	An unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection .

392	It 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .

7955	Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
7956	In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
7957	... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
7958	A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
7959	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
7960	Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
7961	Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
7962	A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
7963	The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
7964	It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
7965	The production values are up there .
7966	The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
7967	The voices are fine as well .
7968	The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
7969	It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
7970	Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
7971	Well , it does go on forever .
7972	This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
7973	Topkapi this is not .
7974	If Shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
7975	Ethan Hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the Beatnik generation and it 's all over his Chelsea Walls .
7976	Equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .
7977	I 'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you 're the kind of person who has seen every Wim Wenders film of the '70s .
7978	While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
7979	If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
7980	A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
7981	Guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
7982	She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
7983	Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
7984	To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
7985	It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
7986	Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
7987	I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
7988	For the most part , the ingredients are there .
7989	But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .
7990	An earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives .
7991	It 's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .
7992	A mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes Chaplin 's City Lights seem dispassionate by comparison .
7993	Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
7994	It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
7995	This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
7996	... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
7997	It 's a trifle .
7998	Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
7999	Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
8000	Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .
8001	After that , it just gets stupid and maudlin .
8002	Too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it 's not a total loss .
8003	Chao was Chen Kaige 's assistant for years in China .
8004	He has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .
8005	A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
8006	The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
8007	Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
8008	The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
8009	If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
8010	So what is the point ?
8011	Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
8012	This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
8013	When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .
8014	When it 's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .
8015	Most new movies have a bright sheen .
8016	Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .
8017	The story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter Paul Pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
8018	You see Robert De Niro singing - and dancing to - West Side Story show tunes .
8019	Choose your reaction : A. -RRB- That sure is funny !
8020	B. -RRB- That sure is pathetic !
8021	A sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
8022	This dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old Hollywood saw : Evil is interesting and good is boring .
8023	Before long , the film starts playing like General Hospital crossed with a Saturday Night Live spoof of Dog Day Afternoon .
8024	The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
8025	Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
8026	But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
8027	A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
8028	Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
8029	The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
8030	Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
8035	Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
8036	It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French -LRB- well , mostly -RRB- with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
8037	This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
8038	Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
8039	Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichÃ©s and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
8040	It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
8041	It 's laughing at us .
8042	Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
8043	Every good actor needs to do his or her own Hamlet .
8044	For Benigni it was n't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio .
8045	It might as well have been Problem Child IV .
8046	Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
8047	Both awful and appealing .
8048	The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
8049	Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
8050	We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
8051	Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
8052	It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
8053	I hated every minute of it .
8054	-LRB- T -RRB- hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the Stepford Wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
8055	Obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of Hey Arnold !
8056	The Movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
8057	There 's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the Disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 MGM version .
8058	A simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .
8059	Roger Michell , who did an appealing job directing Persuasion and Notting Hill in England , gets too artsy in his American debut .
8060	There is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt Seagal 's character ... performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we 're not watching a double .
8061	Anthony Hopkins ?
8062	Big deal !
8063	We 've already seen the prequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal -- and it was better the first time .
8064	Ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .
8065	If this is an example of the type of project that Robert Redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
8066	Pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless Todd Solondzian satire and callow student film .
8067	Not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined TV amiability that Allen personifies .
8068	It 's not that Waiting For Happiness is a bad film , because it is n't .
8069	It 's just incredibly dull .
8070	The sad thing about Knockaround Guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
8071	A cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
8072	Director Ferzan Ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
8073	But he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .
8074	Egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
8075	It wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .
8076	Despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like -LRB- Seinfeld 's -RRB- revered TV show , about pretty much nothing .
8077	Shadyac shoots his film like an M. Night Shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .
8078	Plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .
8079	There are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .
8080	The story 's so preposterous that I did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
8081	I 've heard that the fans of the first Men in Black have come away hating the second one .
8082	I wonder why .
8083	They felt like the same movie to me .
8084	Despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , Witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be America 's Sweetheart .
8085	An ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .
8086	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
8087	De Niro and McDormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story 's inability to create interest .
8088	Even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy ... even for Disney .
8089	That is essentially what 's missing from Blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .
8090	A compendium of Solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
8093	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .
8094	The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
8095	You 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
8096	You 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
8097	Dissing a Bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .
8098	Ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact Amber is such a joke .
8099	Flat , but with a revelatory performance by Michelle Williams .
8100	Little more than a frothy vanity project .
8101	The film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .
8102	Verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .
8103	For all its surface frenzy , High Crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
8104	The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
8105	Alex Nohe 's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget NC-17 version of Tank Girl .
8106	The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
8109	IHOPs do n't pile on this much syrup .
8110	For the most part , I Spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of Murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
8111	focuses on Joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with Spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that I became mad that I wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
8112	This series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last James Bond movie .
8113	A bit of an unwieldy mess .
8114	With a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual Broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
8115	The filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
8116	The movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
8117	A gimmick in search of a movie : how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
8118	... the last time I saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my SATs .
8119	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
8120	... lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar .
8121	It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
8122	It 's tough , astringent , darkly funny and ... well , it 's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning .
8123	Largely a for-fans artifact .
8124	There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
8125	Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
8126	There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .
8127	-LRB- I -RRB- f you 've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you 've already seen this kind of thing .
8129	No reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
8130	A strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
8131	A boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
8132	The vampire thriller Blade II starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
8133	When the first few villians are introduced as `` Spider '' and `` Snake '' you know you 're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak .
8134	An Afterschool Special without the courage of its convictions .
8135	The final result makes for adequate entertainment , I suppose , but anyone who has seen Chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they 've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal .
8136	-LRB- Director -RRB- Byler may yet have a great movie in him , but Charlotte Sometimes is only half of one .
8137	So few movies explore religion that it 's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler .
8138	It 's also clear from the start that The Transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film 's shortcomings start to shine through .
8139	Watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
8140	It 's fun , but a psychological mess , with Austin Powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet .
8141	There are touching moments in Etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
8142	Could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes Fatal Attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
8143	That 's the only sane rationale I can think of for Swimfan 's existence .
8144	I did n't laugh at the ongoing efforts of Cube , and his skinny buddy Mike Epps , to make like Laurel and Hardy 'n the hood .
8145	The only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare .
8146	I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation .
8147	The film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
8148	Immediately .
8149	Human Nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control .
8150	-LRB- It 's -RRB- a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy Vinnie Jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy .
8151	Not even the Hanson Brothers can save it
8152	The thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
8153	... -LRB- a -RRB- strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for Rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
8154	A sour , nasty offering .
8155	Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
8156	Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
8157	It tells more than it shows .
8158	Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
8159	The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
8160	Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
8161	Not every animated film from Disney will become a classic , but forgive me if I 've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school `` cartoon '' .
8162	Do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
8163	Nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and Showtime is crammed full of them .
8164	Much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
8165	This is really just another genre picture .
8166	Each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , Storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception .
8167	William Shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot ...
8168	A trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
8169	Neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
8170	Acting , particularly by Tambor , almost makes `` Never Again '' worthwhile , but -LRB- writer\/director -RRB- Schaeffer should follow his titular advice
8171	Both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent I Spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .
8172	`` Collateral Damage '' goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment -- until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
8173	` Enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
8174	A waste of good performances .
8175	A dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours ... a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle .
8176	I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
8177	But I was n't .
8178	As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
8179	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
8180	The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
8181	Just like Hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
8182	There is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
8183	Where last time jokes flowed out of Cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
8184	Why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from Shirley Jackson , Richard Matheson ... and puke up something like ROSE RED ?
8185	A broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
8186	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
8187	Lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
8188	Though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
8189	perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about .
8190	Wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly -LRB- like one of Hubert 's punches -RRB- , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
8191	Somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
8192	This ill-fitting Tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
8193	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
8194	Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .
8195	Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .
8196	Imagine the James Woods character from Videodrome making a home movie of Audrey Rose and showing it to the kid from The Sixth Sense and you 've imagined The Ring .
8197	This time Kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
8198	An intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
8199	It becomes gimmicky instead of compelling .
8203	Frenetic but not really funny .
8204	Taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise .
8205	If you 're not a prepubescent girl , you 'll be laughing at Britney Spears ' movie-starring debut whenever it does n't have you impatiently squinting at your watch .
8206	A didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
8207	Sluggishly directed by episodic TV veteran Joe Zwick , it 's a sitcom without the snap-crackle .
8208	You could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
8209	Director Clare Kilner 's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
8210	New Best Friend should n't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 video .
8211	Wallace seems less like he 's been burning to tell a war story than he 's been itching to somehow tack one together
8212	The thrill is -LRB- long -RRB- gone .
8213	Began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
8214	Part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole .
8215	Godawful boring slug of a movie .
8216	Dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm .
8217	Scene-by-scene , things happen , but you 'd be hard-pressed to say what or why .
8218	... an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work .
8219	It is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie ... but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made Eurotrash cult object .
8220	It is also , at times , curiously moving .
8221	The tug-of-war at the core of Beijing Bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
8222	Vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe Ghost Ship .
8223	Some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
8224	Being author Wells ' great-grandson , you 'd think filmmaker Simon Wells would have more reverence for the material .
8225	But this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
8226	Offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented .
8227	Mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
8229	Aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
8230	Accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue is n't smart , then you need to use more poetic license .
8231	For all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale .
8232	A soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title .
8233	One groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
8234	Although based on a real-life person , John , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours .
8235	Great story , bad idea for a movie .
8236	With Spy Kids 2 : The Island of Lost Dreams writer\/director\/producer Robert Rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
8237	There is no entry portal in The Rules of Attraction , and I spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters .
8238	It 's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
8239	`` My god , I 'm behaving like an idiot ! ''
8240	Yes , you are , Ben Kingsley .
8241	A dreadful live-action movie .
8242	Divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy .
8243	An earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s .
8244	A hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future Rice adaptations .
8245	All I can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
8246	Between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap .
8247	If you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
8248	Despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still do n't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another .
8249	Every bit as bogus as most Disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
8250	A sensual performance from Abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
8251	Never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
8252	Spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama .
8253	Oedekerk wrote Patch Adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
8254	Why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me .
8255	The creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
8256	Whatever Eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .
8257	Scotland , PA. blurs the line between black comedy and black hole .
8258	It tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .
8259	The whole damn thing is ripe for the Jerry Springer crowd .
8260	It 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
8261	I cry for I Spy -- or I would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-TV spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
8262	A boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk 'n' slash .
8263	What you would end up with if you took Orwell , Bradbury , Kafka , George Lucas and the Wachowski Brothers and threw them into a blender .
8264	But that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
8265	With recent tensions rekindled by the Kathleen Soliah trial and the upcoming trial of SLA members Emily and William Harris , not to mention Sept. 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate Fire 's bright side .
8266	Flaunts its quirky excesses like a New Year 's Eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
8267	Writhing under dialogue like ` You 're from two different worlds ' and ` Tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .
8268	... too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying .
8269	Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco 's last album ?
8270	Faultlessly professional but finally slight .
8271	Schmaltzy and unfunny , Adam Sandler 's cartoon about Hanukkah is numbingly bad , Little Nicky bad , 10 Worst List bad .
8272	It 's really yet another anemic and formulaic Lethal Weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
8273	Scotland , Pa. is a strangely drab romp .
8274	Some studio pizazz might have helped .
8275	When Perry fists a bull at the Moore Farm , it 's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart .
8276	There 's more scatological action in 8 Crazy Nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
8277	Too loud , too long and too frantic by half , Die Another Day suggests that the Bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
8278	The cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the Festival of Lights as Mr. Deeds was to that of Frank Capra .
8279	... the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
8280	The tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
8281	If we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
8282	A modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
8283	Julia is played with exasperating blandness by Laura Regan .
8284	Morrissette 's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it does n't signify a whole lot either .
8285	There 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
8286	All Ms. Jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .
8287	Mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty .
8288	Mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
8289	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
8290	This is n't just the CliffsNotes version of Nicholas Nickleby , it 's the CliffsNotes with pages missing .
8291	Considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
8292	Better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
8293	So clichÃ©d that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
8294	It 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
8295	It might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a Three 's Company-style laugh track .
8296	When the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
8297	Credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
8298	The movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
8299	-LRB- Davis -RRB- has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race .
8300	Does n't amount to much of anything .
8301	Bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
8302	So stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
8303	The truth is that The Truth About Charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
8304	Enduring love but exhausting cinema .
8305	Some of Seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
8306	A ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
8307	A long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
8308	A little too pat for its own good .
8309	There are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
8310	Watching Trouble Every Day , at least if you do n't know what 's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms .
8311	Well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
8312	What would Jesus do if He was a film director ?
8313	He 'd create a movie better than this .
8314	When a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
8315	A very bad sign .
8316	It 's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .
8317	Ca n't kick about the assembled talent and the Russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers .
8318	Still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
8319	Diane Lane shines in Unfaithful .
8320	Almost everything else is wan .
8321	I 'm afraid you wo n't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers B-flick with just a suspension of disbelief .
8322	Rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
8323	So relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
8324	The title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you 'll read anywhere .
8325	The makers of Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood should offer a free ticket -LRB- second prize , of course , two free tickets -RRB- to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
8326	God help the poor woman if Attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional Yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
8327	Let 's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : Stay home .
8328	Undercover Brother does n't go far enough .
8329	It 's just a silly black genre spoof .
8330	The film 's implicit premise is that the faith of the Tonga people is in every way inferior to that of John .
8331	Rates an ` E ' for effort -- and a ` B ' for boring .
8332	You 've already seen Heartbreak if you 've watched the far superior Nurse Betty or Sunset Boulevard .
8333	Even the unwatchable Soapdish is more original .
8335	A journey that 's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which Hoffman 's brilliance almost makes worth taking .
8336	The movie bounces all over the map .
8337	But buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , Freundlich has made just another safe movie .
8338	It 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
8339	Not always too whimsical for its own good -LRB- but enough to do harm -RRB- , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs .
8343	It 's a sometimes interesting remake that does n't compare to the brilliant original .
8344	You 're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
8345	Feel bad for King , who 's honestly trying , and Schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
8346	Some actors steal scenes .
8347	Tom Green just gives them a bad odor .
8348	This self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy Stealing Harvard , but he 's the most obvious one .
8349	Sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well .
8350	The enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
8351	Begins as a promising meditation on one of America 's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
8352	A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
8353	Proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
8354	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .
8355	There 's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in Point Pleasant .
8356	In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
8357	Director Barry Skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of `` The Longest Yard '' playbook like a checklist .
8358	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
8359	Oh , it 's extreme , all right .
8360	Extremely dumb .
8361	Extremely confusing .
8362	Extremely boring .
8363	We never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
8364	For a shoot - 'em - up , Ballistic is oddly lifeless .
8365	One minute , you think you 're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it 's as though clips from The Pink Panther Strikes Again and\/or Sailor Moon have been spliced in .
8366	What happened with Pluto Nash ?
8367	How did it ever get made ?
8368	We may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
8369	Opens as promising as any war\/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` Glory : A Soldier 's Story . ''
8370	The result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
8371	These spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining .
8372	A long slog for anyone but the most committed Pokemon fan .
8373	Matthew McConaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy .
8374	How on earth , or anywhere else , did director Ron Underwood manage to blow $ 100 million on this ?
8375	Everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones .
8376	With a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of Los Angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , The Dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path .
8377	Its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent Dumas botch-jobs , The Man in the Iron Mask and The Musketeer .
8378	A benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
8379	The plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
8380	It 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
8381	It 's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
8382	It does n't help that the director and cinematographer Stephen Kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel .
8383	Desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
8384	This film 's relationship to actual tension is the same as what Christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
8385	John McTiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than Norman Jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
8386	It 's also stupider .
8387	Director Dirk Shafer and co-writer Greg Hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
8388	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
8389	As -LRB- the characters -RRB- get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
8390	The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .
8391	Though Howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this Southern Gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
8392	Falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that are n't funny .
8393	The fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious .
8394	Anyone who can count to five -LRB- the film 's target market ? -RRB-
8395	can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
8396	All this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
8397	Demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
8398	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
8399	-LRB- Plays -RRB- in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
8400	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .
8401	Nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
8402	A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
8403	Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .
8404	If Kaufman kept Cameron Diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
8405	Trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere .
8406	It would be hard to think of a recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun .
8407	Theology aside , why put someone who ultimately does n't learn at the center of a kids ' story ?
8408	All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
8409	Sometimes smart but more often sophomoric .
8410	The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
8411	Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
8412	As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
8413	Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .
8414	Its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing .
8415	A great idea becomes a not-great movie .
8416	... watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life .
8417	And if The Hours wins ` Best Picture ' I just might .
8418	By the end , I was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
8419	Not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
8420	Feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention .
8421	Life is a crock -- or something like it .
8422	Made by jackasses for jackasses .
8423	Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
8424	The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
8425	Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
8426	Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
8427	A bravura exercise in emptiness .
8428	Philip K. Dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach .
8429	Despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
8430	All prints of this film should be sent to and buried on Pluto .
8431	Not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well .
8432	First good , then bothersome .
8433	Excellent acting and direction .
8434	This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
8435	It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
8436	Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
8437	So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
8438	Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
8439	Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
8440	A long-winded , predictable scenario .
8441	Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
8442	Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
8443	Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
8444	This movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray .
8445	It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .
8446	Melanie eventually slugs the Yankee .
8447	Too bad the former Murphy Brown does n't pop Reese back .
8448	At the bottom rung of the series ' entries .
8449	A real clunker .
8450	A well-made , thoughtful , well-acted clunker , but a clunker nonetheless .
8451	A dreary rip-off of Goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for Hispanic Americans .
8452	The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
8453	Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
8454	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
8455	A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
8456	Lawrence preaches strictly to the converted .
8457	As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
8458	Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
8459	Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
8460	Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
8461	... the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs .
8462	The only thing in Pauline and Paulette that you have n't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized Oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .
8463	If you 're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere .
8464	It virtually defines a comedy that 's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while .
8465	An instant candidate for worst movie of the year .
8466	Despite its title , Amy 's Orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one .
8467	Like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , John Q. is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .
8468	Adam Sandler is to Gary Cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
8469	What kids will discover is a new collectible .
8470	What parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
8471	Beers , who , when she 's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall ... -LRB- but -RRB- the script goes wrong at several key junctures .
8472	Without September 11 , Collateral Damage would have been just another bad movie .
8473	Now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .
8474	Drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
8475	There 's a disturbing ` Great White Hope ' undertone to The Other Side of Heaven that subtly undermines its message of Christian love and compassion .
8476	Unless you are in dire need of a Diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it .
8477	Wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
8478	The attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven .
8479	There 's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about .
8480	Too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
8481	When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
8482	Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
8483	Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .
8484	The more Kevin Costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like Dragonfly tossed at them .
8485	-LRB- It 's -RRB- difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of American Chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
8486	The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .
8487	Taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore .
8488	But as a movie , it 's a humorless , disjointed mess .
8489	If Myers decides to make another Austin Powers movie , maybe he should just stick with Austin and Dr Evil .
8490	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
8491	Too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , Frank Novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
8492	Overly stylized with lots of flash black - & - white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , -LRB- it 's -RRB- at its worst when it 's actually inside the ring .
8493	What is captured during the conceptual process does n't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , The Selection , became in its final form .
8494	If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
8495	Had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin .
8496	These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
8497	Imagine if you will a Tony Hawk skating video interspliced with footage from Behind Enemy Lines and set to Jersey shore techno .
8498	It does n't quite work , but there 's enough here to make us look forward to the Russos ' next offering .
8499	Any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment .
8500	The director 's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship -LRB- most notably wretched sound design -RRB- .
8501	About as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
8502	Apparently kissing leads to suicide attempts and tragic deaths .
8503	Marisa Tomei is good , but Just A Kiss is just a mess .
8504	Opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
8505	The noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in Sorority Boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
8506	To portray modern women the way director Davis has done is just unthinkable .
8507	Too simple for its own good .
8508	Flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
8509	A chaotic panorama that 's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags .
8510	Suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
8511	The screenplay sabotages the movie 's strengths at almost every juncture .
8512	All the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable .
8513	A trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience .
8520	The performances are so leaden , Michael Rymer 's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud .
8521	A subtle variation on I Spit On Your Grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men .
8522	Reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified Nike ad .
8523	As Tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne TV sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up .
8524	If somebody was bored and ... decided to make a dull , pretentious version of Jesus ' Son , they 'd come up with something like Bart Freundlich 's World Traveler .
8525	The best you can say about it is it 's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now .
8526	A tough go , but Leigh 's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film 's often-mined and despairing milieu .
8527	An overstuffed compendium of teen-Catholic-movie dogma .
8528	Too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing .
8529	Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan , Tom Clancy 's intrepid hero ?
8530	Ridiculous .
8531	What 's next ?
8532	D.J. Qualls as Indiana Jones ?
8533	Or Tom Green as Han Solo ?
8534	The movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
8535	The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge .
8536	These are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future .
8537	If this is the resurrection of the Halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
8538	This formulaic chiller will do little to boost Stallone 's career .
8539	I saw Knockaround Guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the Spanish-American War ... It 's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink .
8540	Though Avary has done his best to make something out of Ellis ' nothing novel , in the end , his Rules is barely worth following .
8541	The average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town America .
8542	No worse than a lot of the crap we 've been offered this summer , and slightly better than Men in Black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .
8543	The plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before Sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
8544	At first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin .
8545	Never Again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
8546	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : They Might Be Giants ' So to Be One of Us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
8547	Technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial .
8548	The title 's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is .
8549	The parts are better than the whole -LRB- bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in New York -RRB- .
8550	While the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an American movie might demand , Scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a Hollywood production .
8551	The humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny .
8552	It 's a movie forged in the fires of Chick Flick Hell .
8553	Its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper .
8554	Any one episode of The Sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
8555	Feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the Lifetime cable television network .
8556	Lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and Does n't Know How to Have Fun .
8557	Credit must be given to Harland Williams , Michael Rosenbaum and Barry Watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
8558	Denzel Washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
8559	If this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap -LRB- literally -RRB- .
8560	So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check .
8561	Rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
8562	There 's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent .
8563	I can only imagine one thing worse than Kevin Spacey trying on an Irish accent , and that 's sultry Linda Fiorentino doing the same thing .
8564	An awkward and indigestible movie .
8565	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
8566	Haneke keeps us at arm 's length .
8567	Guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens .
8568	All the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that The Believer feels like a 12-Step Program for the Jewish Nazi .
8569	Like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness .
8570	There 's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong .
8571	This is an hour and a half of daydreaming .
8572	Message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ?
8573	Alas , it 's neither .
8574	No movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
8575	` Dragonfly ' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck .
8576	Thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
8577	Now it 's just tired .
8578	Heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension .
8579	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .
8580	A thinly veiled excuse for Wilson to play his self-deprecating act against Murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
8581	A minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
8582	The movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark .
8583	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .
8584	It will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
8585	But here 's the real damn : It is n't funny , either .
8586	Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
8587	The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
8588	What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
8589	Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .
8590	Looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a Mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
8591	The period -- swinging London in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in Gangster No. 1 , but falls apart long before the end .
8592	High Crimes miscasts nearly every leading character .
8593	The overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the Star Trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
8594	De Niro looks bored , Murphy recycles Murphy , and you mentally add Showtime to the pile of Hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
8595	I did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
8596	Another rent installment for the Ian Fleming estate .
8597	With Danilo Donati 's witty designs and Dante Spinotti 's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children 's movie -- if only Benigni had n't insisted on casting himself in the title role .
8598	So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
8599	Though it draws several decent laughs , it 's low-cal Woody at best .
8600	Has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags .
8603	Well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .
8604	Sadly , Hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
8605	If Melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna .
8606	This film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
8607	Just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story .
8608	Or a profit .
8609	Or some damn thing .
8610	The acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from Gilligan 's Island -- and the CGI Scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
8611	Enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .
8612	The makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
8613	I like Frank the Pug , though .
8614	A restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor 's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .
8615	Gee , a second assassin shot Kennedy ?
8616	Moot point .
8617	A hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
8618	Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
8619	The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
8620	Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
8621	Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
8622	If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .
8623	The episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
8624	But the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
8625	Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
8626	But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
8627	Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .
8628	Though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like Mr. Schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
8629	Hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it 's heading .
8630	Intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
8631	Sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .
8632	Director Brian Levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a French poodle .
8633	... perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world .
8634	Suggests puns about ingredients and soup and somebody being off their noodle , but let 's just say the ingredients do n't quite add up to a meal .
8635	I 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of Chicago torn apart by dingoes .
8636	Movies like this are selling the old European candor , the old wink of ` bold ' revelation .
8637	But in 2002 , such revelations wilt .
8638	The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .
8640	A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .
8641	Flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .
8642	Even if you feel like you 've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to Belushi 's easy-going likableness .
8643	The story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .
8644	Despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy .
8645	McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
8646	A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
8647	The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
8648	Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
8649	Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .
8650	When she speaks , her creepy Egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .
8651	Outrageousness is all Plympton seemed to be going for this time .
8652	We miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
8653	Much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing -LRB- the movie 's -RRB- mindset .
8654	Well before it 's over , Beijing Bicycle begins spinning its wheels .
8655	Home Alone goes Hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even Steven Spielberg would know how to do .
8656	Besides , real movie producers are n't this nice .
8657	-LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .
8658	Passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes .
8659	For me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
8660	Looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
8661	Truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
8662	Abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
8663	Even die-hard fans of Japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
8664	Filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
8665	Fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .
8666	The movie gets muted and routine .
8667	The issue of faith is not explored very deeply
8669	The situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
8670	It 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
8671	I was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness .
8672	K-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy Saving Private Ryanovich .
8673	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
8674	Automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
8675	The film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .
8676	Feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
8677	Ja Rule and Kurupt should have gotten to rap .
8678	It would have benefitted the dialogue .
8679	A standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .
8680	Elicits more groans from the audience than Jar Jar Binks , Scrappy Doo and Scooby Dumb , all wrapped up into one .
8681	It 's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .
8682	In the end , White Oleander is n't an adaptation of a novel .
8683	It 's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .
8684	This film , starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock , is your typical ` fish out of water ' story .
8685	You 've seen them a million times .
8686	Just one problem : Fish out of water usually die .
8687	This one does .
8688	The angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .
8689	A soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
8690	Men in Black II has sequel-itis something fierce .
8691	An ungainly , comedy-deficient , B-movie rush job ...
8692	A combination of standard , stiff TV-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .
8693	An unsatisfying hybrid of Blair Witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
8694	Say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
8695	After seeing SWEPT AWAY , I feel sorry for Madonna .
8696	Instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , Hart 's War , like the St. Louis Rams in the Super Bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
8697	A gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of Moore 's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e .
8698	Maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
8699	Boring we did n't .
8700	Never quite transcends jokester status ... and the punchline does n't live up to Barry 's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .
8701	The film 's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .
8702	It almost plays like Solaris , but with guns and jokes .
8703	A baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie -LRB- Woody Allen -RRB- has made in the last twenty years .
8704	It wo n't be long before you 'll spy I Spy at a video store near you .
8705	This film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
8706	Propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
8707	There is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
8708	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
8709	Earnest but earthbound ... a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama\/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .
8710	The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
8711	For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
8712	A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .
8713	If I Spy were funny -LRB- enough -RRB- or exciting -LRB- enough -RRB- then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
8714	Frustratingly , Dridi tells us nothing about El Gallo other than what emerges through his music .
8715	Places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .
8717	A very average science fiction film .
8718	Undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
8719	How anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .
8720	The sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .
8721	The cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
8722	The plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
8723	ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
8724	A whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .
8725	Those who managed to avoid the Deconstructionist theorizing of French philosopher Jacques Derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary Derrida .
8726	Or , you can do something fun tonight .
8727	Jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
8728	As with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
8729	Static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , Hey Arnold !
8730	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
8731	For all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that Kapur tries to bring to The Four Feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .
8732	When it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than Pokemon 4Ever .
8733	What The Four Feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .
8734	While Benigni -LRB- who stars and co-wrote -RRB- seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .
8735	Yes , 4Ever is harmless in the extreme and it 'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to Spirited Away ?
8736	Preposterous and tedious , Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .
8737	Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
8738	None of these characters resembles anyone you 've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .
8739	... just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .
8740	As elegantly crafted as it often is , Anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
8741	Splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
8742	... has virtually no script at all ...
8743	Will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
8744	This kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch .
8745	But director Danny DeVito and screenwriter Adam Resnick -LRB- remember Cabin Boy ? -RRB-
8746	just pound away .
8747	At times , however , Dogtown and Z-Boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
8748	Rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation .
8749	Screenwriters Scott Abbott and Michael Petroni have turned Rice 's complex Akasha into a cartoon monster .
8750	The writers , director Wally Wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : Kappa Rho Alpha Phi .
8751	Bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
8752	The new faces are interesting , but the old story is n't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted .
8753	Most of the action setups are incoherent .
8754	Liman , of Swingers and Go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase .
8755	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
8756	The problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of Schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
8757	Dreary , highly annoying ... ` Some Body ' will appeal to No One .
8758	There 's something deeply creepy about Never Again , a new arrow in Schaeffer 's quiver of ineptitudes .
8759	The problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there 's no saving the movie .
8760	Sorry , Charlie
8761	A painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots .
8762	Blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but Ahola is simply not an actor .
8763	And in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Spencer Tracy .
8764	The cartoon that is n't really good enough to be on afternoon TV is now a movie that is n't really good enough to be in theaters .
8765	Shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker 's bottomless pit of self-absorption .
8766	This pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
8767	All ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
8768	If this is the Danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps .
8769	Formula 51 is so trite that even Yu 's high-energy action stylings ca n't break through the stupor .
8770	Only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry .
8771	When the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you 're in trouble .
8772	-LRB- Two -RRB- fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable Scandinavian settlers in 18th-century Canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now .
8773	The film is really not so much bad as bland .
8774	The central story lacks punch .
8775	Though Ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
8776	This may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
8777	Succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the Touched by an Angel school of non-God spiritual-uplift movies .
8778	A harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
8779	What was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical .
8780	The kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
8781	`` Men in Black II , '' has all the earmarks of a sequel .
8782	The story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ?
8783	Sucking all the ` classic ' out of Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and Disney-fied adolescent angst ...
8784	This 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it 's a tad slow .
8785	While Super Troopers is above Academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
8786	A mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original .
8787	The low-budget Full Frontal was one of the year 's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and Solaris is its big-budget brother .
8788	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
8789	The film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future Quentin Tarantino picture
8790	A free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
8791	Apallingly absurd ... the chemistry or lack thereof between Newton and Wahlberg could turn an Imax theater into a 9 '' black and white portable TV .
8792	A well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
8793	The smug , oily demeanor that Donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named Pipe Dream is just repulsive .
8794	Must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry .
8795	Others may find it migraine-inducing , despite Moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
8796	Despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , Super Troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development .
8797	It 's hard not to feel you 've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story .
8798	I watched the brainless insanity of No Such Thing with mounting disbelief .
8799	This limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's Tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
8800	Kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
8801	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .
8802	Any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes .
8803	Like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
8804	I loved looking at this movie .
8805	I just did n't care as much for the story .
8806	Has all the poignancy of a Hallmark card and all the comedy of a Gallagher stand-up act .
8807	It does n't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality .
8808	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
8809	A gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising .
8811	It feels like a community theater production of a great Broadway play : Even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original .
8812	The film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other .
8813	The element of surprise might be the only thing Femme Fatale has going for it .
8814	It 's the kind of movie you ca n't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you ca n't bring yourself to dislike it .
8815	Maybe it 's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , I want a little more than this .
8816	A graceless , witless attempt at mating Some Like It Hot with the WWII espionage thriller .
8817	The story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough .
8818	Based on a David Leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
8819	Just like every other Seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail .
8820	To enjoy this movie 's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by Jolie and Burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending .
8821	National Lampoon 's Van Wilder could be the worst thing to come out of National Lampoon since Class Reunion
8822	This is a great subject for a movie , but Hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director John Woo has built his career on .
8823	Ecks this one off your must-see list .
8824	Overall , the film misses the brilliance of Jelinek 's novel by some way .
8825	It settles for being merely grim .
8826	The Irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
8827	It 's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie .
8828	No , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so Children of the Century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
8829	Just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
8830	Just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after -LRB- or during -RRB- consumption of its second half .
8831	Every so often a movie comes along that confirms one 's worse fears about civilization as we know it .
8832	The New Guy is one of them .
8833	This is n't a `` Friday '' worth waiting for .
8834	Everything that 's worthwhile about Collision Course can already be seen on television .
8835	If this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called Beta Alpha Delta .
8836	Not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey .
8837	Uneasy mishmash of styles and genres .
8838	Herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among Germany and Eastern European Jews might have changed 20th-Century history is undermined by Ahola 's inadequate performance .
8839	All in all , there 's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone .
8840	Beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
8841	Secret Ballot is too contemplative to be really funny .
8842	The film 's center will not hold .
8843	Myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we 're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another .
8844	Too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
8845	A great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and Crazy as Hell does n't even have a great ending .
8846	Dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
8847	Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
8848	As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
8849	A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
8850	I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
8851	Nothing about it fits .
8852	As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
8853	Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
8854	The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
8855	Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
8856	The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
8857	I tried to read the time on my watch .
8858	The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
8859	Johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to .
8860	Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
8861	The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
8862	The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
8863	The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
8864	Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
8865	There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
8866	It seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less .
8867	The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
8868	Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
8869	The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
8870	Just a bloody mess .
8871	Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
8872	You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
8873	Has something to say ... but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller .
8874	Bears is bad .
8875	Not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' I once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
8876	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .
8877	George , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please .
8878	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .
8879	However clever Nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release .
8880	Extreme Oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it 's still a mistake to go see it .
8881	What could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent .
8882	What will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
8883	... too dull to enjoy .
8884	A morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-TV look , rigid performances and an asinine ` twist ' that brazenly rips off The Sixth Sense .
8885	Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
8886	Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
8887	But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
8888	A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
8889	It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
8890	The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
8891	Going to the website may be just as fun -LRB- and scary -RRB- as going to the film .
8892	Lacking gravitas , MacDowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
8893	Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
8894	Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .
8895	For Caine Lovers only .
8896	A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
8897	De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
8898	But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
8899	No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
8900	A reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided .
8901	The rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it 's more comedy than suspense De Palma creates .
8902	Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
8903	City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
8904	But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
8905	The Marquis de Sade could n't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be .
8906	What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
8907	The cast is uniformly excellent ... but the film itself is merely mildly charming .
8908	Drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that Three Seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality .
8909	A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
8910	The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
8911	Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
8912	And forget about any attempt at a plot !
8913	It will probably prove interesting to Ram Dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture .
8914	Take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we 've seen and all you have left are John Leguizamo 's cool jackets .
8915	It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
8916	Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
8917	It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
8918	The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
8919	` How many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
8920	Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
8921	Fans of the TV series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored .
8922	The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
8923	Barely goes beyond comic book status .
8924	It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
8925	I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
8926	It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
8927	An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
8928	Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
8929	Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
8930	-LRB- Morgan -RRB- , Judd and Franklin ca n't save the script , rooted in a novel by Joseph Finder , from some opportunism .
8931	Passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless .
8932	Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
8933	My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
8934	Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
8935	Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
8936	It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
8937	It 's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner .
8938	A sudsy cautionary tale .
8939	A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .
8940	Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
8941	Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
8942	Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
8943	Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
8944	As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
8945	Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
8946	On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
8947	The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
8948	One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
8949	... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
8950	Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
8951	The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
8952	Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
8953	-LRB- Sen 's -RRB- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
8954	Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
8955	Sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre .
8956	Do n't waste your money .
8957	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .
8958	There are n't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of Georgian Jews in Tel Aviv .
8959	There 's not enough to sustain the comedy .
8960	Like those to Rome , all roads in The Banger Sisters inevitably lead to a joke about Hawn 's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them .
8961	We may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the Balkans conflict .
8962	You 're better off staying home and watching The X-Files .
8963	Chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it 's ... like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror .
8964	Bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences .
8965	This is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
8966	Friday After Next has the same problem that Next Friday did -- it 's called Where 's Chris Tucker When You Need Him ?
8967	This film is full of rabbits .
8968	Brimful .
8969	But like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
8970	I weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider Blue Crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
8971	I kept wishing I was watching a documentary about the wartime Navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious Hollywood hoo-ha .
8972	No number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story .
8973	A movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious Charlie Kaufman might object to .
8974	Could The Country Bears really be as bad as its trailers ?
8975	In a word -- yes .
8976	If High Crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title .
8977	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .
8978	The movie makes absolutely no sense .
8979	Its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : Since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ?
8980	The problem with this film is that it 's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot .
8981	Had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago .
8982	Despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
8983	Murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous .
8984	The journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie .
8985	That Zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered .
8986	The Gantzes ' interviews tend to let the guys off the hook .
8987	The streets , shot by cinematographer Michael Ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .
8988	This is a good movie in spurts , but when it does n't work , it 's at important times .
8989	Parker probably thinks he 's shaking up a classic the way Kenneth Branagh and Baz Luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss Wilde 's still-contemporary play .
8990	Flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising .
8991	A TV episode inflated past its natural length .
8992	Involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd .
8993	All these developments and challenges facing Santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .
8994	There are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they 're not exactly flattering .
8995	The unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
8996	The story ... is moldy and obvious .
8997	It 's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it 's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff .
8998	Suffocated at conception by its Munchausen-by-proxy mum .
8999	Punish the vehicle to adore the star .
9000	Even if Britney Spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .
9001	Big Fat Liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities .
9002	Usually when I get this much syrup , I like pancakes to go with it .
9003	All the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure .
9004	Glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .
9005	Gangs of New York is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up .
9006	An overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences .
9007	Without a strong script and energetic acting , Dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
9008	A mild , reluctant , thumbs down .
9009	Strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and B-film thuggery .
9010	Schindler 's List it ai n't .
9011	A cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency .
9012	It 's an awfully derivative story .
9014	It 's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable .
9015	About as cutting-edge as Pet Rock : The Movie .
9016	With generic sets and B-grade special effects , Jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as TV 's defunct Cleopatra 2525 .
9017	Not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed .
9018	Winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
9019	Oft-described as the antidote to American Pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
9020	The pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie 's final scenes .
9021	The premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the Clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
9022	With its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , The Ring makes its stupidity more than obvious .
9023	It 's painful .
9025	An uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
9026	Sheridan ... smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth .
9027	An atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding .
9028	Half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
9029	Writer\/director John McKay ignites some charming chemistry between Kate and Jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and Kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
9030	-LRB- Newton -RRB- wanders through CHARLIE completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
9031	Unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
9032	I found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
9033	A lousy movie that 's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable .
9034	The best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations .
9035	Then lower them a bit more .
9036	When not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since Macy Gray 's game of Chinese whispers with Mr Bean .
9037	Cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke .
9038	A woozy , roisterous , exhausting mess , and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as ill-starred as you might expect .
9039	` Abandon all hope , ye who enter here ' ... you should definitely let Dante 's gloomy words be your guide .
9040	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .
9041	A grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
9042	Birot 's directorial debut -LRB- she co-wrote the script with Christophe HonorÃ© -RRB- is n't so much bad as it is bland .
9043	Watching the film is like reading a Times Portrait of Grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it .
9044	Enough similarities to Gymkata and Howie Long 's Firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs .
9045	Succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the Police Academy series .
9046	Christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their Lord as a luv-spreading Dr. Feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise God for delivering such an instant camp classic .
9047	If this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called The Hills Have Antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins .
9048	A frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favour the audience .
9049	Like a documentary version of Fight Club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest .
9050	`` An entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . ''
9051	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
9052	What 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
9053	The stories here suffer from the chosen format .
9054	While the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat 's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun .
9055	Just how extreme are these ops ?
9056	I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
9057	The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
9058	John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
9059	The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
9060	Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
9062	Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
9064	The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
9065	The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .
9066	The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
9067	It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
9068	A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
9069	None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
9070	Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
9071	Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
